                <h1>1.Write Code/Build Stuf</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><q>Want to get better at writing code? Write code! Crazy huh?!</q></span></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Build Something for Yourself</h3>
                <p>I know what you’re thinking… “but what do I build?”. Well, think about
                    something that would be useful for yourself. I’ve been playing lots of
                    disc golf recently, and I could use an app to help track my scores.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span><q>Start with a small idea, build it out, and then expand on it!</q></span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This might start out simple, but I could easily build out more advanced
                    features like authentication, saving scores in a database, sharing scores
                    with friends, etc. The cool thing is you’ll be motivated to finish an app
                    that you benefit from.</p>

                <h3>You Need Projects on Your Portfolio</h3>
                <p>One of the other big benefits of building out a few sample projects is that
                    you can (and should) use them on your portfolio. When you’re looking
                    for your first job, you don’t have the professional experience to show,
                    but you can talk about side projects you’ve worked on.</p>

                <h1>2. Take Your Time and Focus on What You Enjoy</h1>
                <p>It’s common to jump into programming and quickly feel overwhelmed.
                    Every day, you’ll hear people talking about the hot new library, framework, etc. It’s easy to get
                    lost in the whirlwind and not know where to
                    start or where to go next.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span><q>Strive for understanding, not speed!</q></span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Wherever you start your journey (JavaScript, Python, HTML, etc.), take
                    your time and strive for understanding before moving on to a new
                    concept. Don’t sweat it if you have to follow the same tutorial ten times
                    before it clicks…we’ve all been there. Embrace the learning process, and
                    don’t let your original expectations (or expectations from others) push
                    you to move too quickly</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span><q>Focus on the things that you enjoy the most!</q></span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>What do you get most excited about? Frontend, backend, design,
                    databases, infrastructure, automation? Don’t be afraid to branch out
                    and gain experience in different areas, but make sure to let yourself enjoy
                    the things you work on.</p>
