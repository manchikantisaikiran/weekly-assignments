            <h1>1.Write Code/Build Stuf</h1>
            <p>Want to get better at writing code? Write code! Crazy huh?!</p>
            <h3>Build Something for Yourself</h3>
            <pre>I know what you’re thinking… “but what do I build?”. Well, think about
                something that would be useful for yourself. I’ve been playing lots of
                disc golf recently, and I could use an app to help track my scores.

                <b>Start with a small idea, build it out, and then expand on it!</b>

                This might start out simple, but I could easily build out more advanced
                features like authentication, saving scores in a database, sharing scores
                with friends, etc. The cool thing is you’ll be motivated to finish an app
                that you benefit from.</pre>

            <h3>You Need Projects on Your Portfolio</h3>
            <p>One of the other big benefits of building out a few sample projects is that
                you can (and should) use them on your portfolio. When you’re looking
                for your first job, you don’t have the professional experience to show,
                but you can talk about side projects you’ve worked on.</p>
            
            <h1>2. Take Your Time and Focus on What You Enjoy</h1>
            <pre>   It’s common to jump into programming and quickly feel overwhelmed.
                Every day, you’ll hear people talking about the hot new library, framework, etc. It’s easy to get lost in the whirlwind and not know where to
                start or where to go next.
                
                <b>Strive for understanding, not speed!</b>
                
                    Wherever you start your journey (JavaScript, Python, HTML, etc.), take
                your time and strive for understanding before moving on to a new
                concept. Don’t sweat it if you have to follow the same tutorial ten times
                before it clicks…we’ve all been there. Embrace the learning process, and
                don’t let your original expectations (or expectations from others) push
                you to move too quickly

                <b>Focus on the things that you enjoy the most!</b>

                    What do you get most excited about? Frontend, backend, design,
                databases, infrastructure, automation? Don’t be afraid to branch out
                and gain experience in different areas, but make sure to let yourself enjoy
                the things you work on.
