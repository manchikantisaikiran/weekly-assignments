                <h2>What we do</h2>
                <p>The Issue - “Last Mile” distribution networks in emerging markets are highly inefficient,
                    significantly
                    increasing the cost of living for billions of people in these markets. For the last 20 years, the
                    leading global companies have invested billions in trying to solve the Last Mile challenge. But
                    failed.
                </p>
                <p>N-Frnds - the First to Succeed - The N-Frnds unique “Last Mile” hybrid, multi-product distribution
                    network for emerging markets, connects consumer goods brands, insurers and financial institutions
                    with
                    small retailers and consumers unlocking growth. Our Hybrid platform combines technology with the
                    traditional distribution network. We set up and manage the physical network of sales agents
                    (Pre-Sellers) who work with our efficient network of selected wholesalers. We provide the digital
                    solution to all participants in the network (e.g. wholesalers, retailers). Global scale - Over 20M
                    users
                    on the platform (mobile, web, USSD), a proven business model, 21 patents, successful live networks
                    in
                    South East Asia and Africa.

                <p>Coca Cola - Strategic Global Anchor Customer – Signed Long Term Agreement - Coca Cola was impressed
                    at
                    the significant growth and impact on their revenues from joining the N-Frnds network, as well as on
                    the
                    quality of the valuable new data and transactions we generate in a previously “data-white space”
                    enabling us to create unique loyalty plans for the Last Mile. As a result, Coca Cola selected
                    N-Frnds
                    and signed a strategic long-term agreement with us to provide and manage their “last mile” indirect
                    distribution network in emerging markets (ordering, fulfillment, loyalty and financial services).
